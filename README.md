# NicOS
An operating system that will one day be superior to all currently existing operating systems.  Plans: 32-bit.  Custom 2-stage bootloader. Might make a UEFI bootloader because who uses BIOS anymore.  Only x86 support.  POSIX compliant and with System V ABI implementation to run your favorite Linux programs.  Might be a microkernel. .. Slab, slub, and buddy allocator.
[Work In Progress]
